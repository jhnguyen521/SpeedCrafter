## Summary
For our project, we want to give our agent a recipe or list of resources which the agent must find and collect by exploring the world around it. The agent would be placed in a normally-generated world with a given world seed. The agent would be given limited information about its immediate surroundings in the form of a three-dimensional grid and would have to explore to find additional resources. It would also need to be aware of and react to potential hazards in the area. Our project has applications in problems that involve searching for objects in unfamiliar areas.

## Approach

## Evaluation
<!--
The agent will be evaluated on its efficiency in finding the given resources. Every action taken will incur a small negative reward to encourage the agent to complete the task with fewer actions. For example, moving 1 block can have a "reward" of -0.005, while mining a block other than the targeted one can have a larger penalty of -0.01. Taking damage (such as falling or touching lava) will also incur larger penalties to encourage the agent to avoid hazards.

The agent will also be evaluated on its ability to collect resources and fulfill tasks of varying complexities. Simple tasks such as gathering wood would give a lower reward
