## Summary

## AI/ML Algorithms

## Evaluation Plan

One factor that will be evaluated is the agent's efficiency in gathering the required resources. This can be things like the time taken to gather all of the resources, the total distance traveled, the number of blocks broken, and/or the amount of damage taken by the player. One possible approach to improving the efficiency is to test different mining methods, such as which Y-level the agent mines at or the pattern that they mine in.

The project will also be evaluated on the complexity of the tasks performed. To ensure that the AI is generalized enough, it can be tested with different types of resources such as ores, dirt, plants, or a combination of them. A particularly impressive result would include things such as killing mobs and finding structures, such as obtaining Blaze Rods (which involve obtaining obsidian to build a Nether Portal, finding a Nether Fortress and killing blazes without dying).
